**tl;dr** To make long document re-ranking more efficient, we propose an intra-document cascading strategy, which prunes passages of a candidate document using a less expensive model, called ESM, before running a scoring model that
is more expensive and effective, called ETM. We found it best to
train ESM (short for Efficient Student Model) via knowledge distillation from the ETM (short for Effective Teacher Model) e.g., BERT.
This pruning allows us to only run the ETM model on a smaller
set of passages whose size does not vary by document length, reducing the overall latency.

## Trained Models

We provide the following full-trained DistilBERT-based IDCM model (cascading 4x 64 token windows per document) via the HuggingFace model hub:

We have getting started guides for training teachers & students, as well as a range of other possibilities for neural re-ranking training.
